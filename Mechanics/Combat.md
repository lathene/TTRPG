A poise type mechanic, where each chracter has a certain damage threshold which, once reached, leaves them stunned for a turn.

A turn is determined as a set number of points that the player will spend to take actions. Attacks and spells will have the Action Point cost in their description, and movement will be determiend by 1 AP to being 10 feet a character can move. Each player will be given 5 points at base, with certain spells and abilities modifying that number or the cost of thing accordingly.

A player can save AP for reactions with a feat that allows it.

Armor offers damage reduction rather than Armor Class style defense. 

[[Initiative]]

Armor acts as a shell that you must get through to reach the health bar. Also, armor has a damage reduction threshold of which damage must equal or excede for damage to be dealt.

If a character is dealt 1/2(rounded up) their total health damage in purely bludgeon damage in one turn, they are knocked unconcious.

Every character has an extra Ap, which they can spend to miev 10 feet. If they do this, they will take a point of exertion, which add up over time.
